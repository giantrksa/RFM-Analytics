# Data Processing & Analysis for RFM Model

This project aims to help you understand the process of data extraction, cleaning, and analysis for creating an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Model. We are using a dataset containing transaction data, customer data, and store data.

### Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- openpyxl

To install these packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy openpyxl
```

### Project Overview

The project mainly involves the following steps:

- Importing datasets
- Analyzing and understanding the data
- Data cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Building the RFM Model

### Dataset

We have three excel sheets named data-rfm-confidential.xlsx containing different data:

1. Transaction Data: Each row corresponds to a transaction and includes details such as transaction ID, date, store ID, customer ID, transaction status, and amount.

2. Customer Data: Contains customer details like customer ID, first name, last name, email, birthday, and gender.

3. Store Data: Contains details about the store.

### Data Cleaning

Before we perform the analysis, we need to clean up the data to make it suitable for further analysis. Here are the key steps we take to clean the data:

- **Filling missing emails:** We fill in missing email values by using the first name and last name of the customer.

- **Extracting date and hour from the transaction date:** We also create new columns to separate the date and hour from the transaction date. We also get the day name from the transaction date.

- **Filtering 'accepted' transactions:** We focus only on the transactions that have been accepted. 

### Feature Engineering

In this step, we add new features to the data which can help us in building our model:

- **DateOnly, HourOnly, DayName:** These fields are derived from the TrxDate column and provide the date, hour, and day of the week for each transaction respectively.

### Building the RFM Model

The RFM Model is a customer segmentation model that uses past purchase behavior to divide customers into groups. RFM stands for the three dimensions:

- Recency – How recently did the customer make a purchase?
- Frequency – How often do they purchase?
- Monetary Value – How much do they spend?

After creating RFM features, we can perform RFM analysis or other downstream tasks such as customer segmentation or building predictive models.

Please refer to the code for detailed implementation.

**Note:** This is a simple RFM analysis. Depending on your requirements, the RFM model can become more complex. For example, you might need to adjust your definition of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value depending on the nature of your business and the specific behaviors of your customers. 

Happy coding!
